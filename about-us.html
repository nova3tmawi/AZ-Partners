                        <p>AZ Partners is a Palestinian consultancy firm committed to empowering mission-driven organizations, NGOs, and SMEs with the tools and strategies they need to succeed. With over 15 years of hands-on experience in development, project management, and capacity building, we help our partners move from ideas to measurable impact — with clarity, confidence, and precision.</p>
                        <p>We bring together a diverse team of experts from across the development, education, and private sectors. What unites us is a shared belief in responsible, ethical, and practical consulting. We listen closely, respond thoughtfully, and walk alongside our clients as they grow, adapt, and lead. At AZ, we don’t just deliver services. We build partnerships.</p>

                        <h3><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>To help organizations and businesses turn their vision into measurable, sustainable outcomes through tailored consulting, strategic planning, and capacity-building support.</p>

                        <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Our Approach</h3>
                        <p>At AZ Partners, we believe that impact grows from listening, strategy, and values in action. That’s why our approach blends customized technical support with a deep commitment to the principles that shape meaningful, responsible development. We start by understanding your context — not just your goals, but your constraints, environment, and stakeholders. From there, we co-design strategies and solutions that are realistic, data-informed, and owned by your team. Our consulting style is collaborative, not prescriptive.</p>
                        <p>Our work is grounded in five guiding commitments:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We operate with integrity and transparency in every interaction.</li>
                            <li>We follow a strict Do No Harm principle in sensitive and high-stakes contexts.</li>
                            <li>We prioritize local ownership, inclusion, and responsiveness.</li>
                            <li>We pursue excellence through continuous learning and quality improvement.</li>
                            <li>We believe in long-term partnership, not one-time solutions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We are a multidisciplinary group of consultants, project managers, trainers, and specialists. Each member brings deep knowledge in their field — from proposal development and MEAL systems to financial planning, PR strategy, and organizational design. We combine strategic expertise with cultural sensitivity, field experience, and a collaborative mindset. This allows us to support a wide range of partners — from grassroots organizations to international development agencies — with agility, professionalism, and care.</p>
