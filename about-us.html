                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>To help organizations and businesses turn their vision into measurable, sustainable outcomes through tailored consulting, strategic planning, and capacity-building support.</p>

                        <h3>Our Vision</h3>

                        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                        <p>At AZ Partners, we believe that impact grows from listening, strategy, and values in action. That’s why our approach blends customized technical support with a deep commitment to the principles that shape meaningful, responsible development. We start by understanding your context — not just your goals, but your constraints, environment, and stakeholders. From there, we co-design strategies and solutions that are realistic, data-informed, and owned by your team. Our consulting style is collaborative, not prescriptive.</p>
                        <p>Our work is grounded in five guiding commitments:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We operate with integrity and transparency in every interaction.</li>
                            <li>We follow a strict Do No Harm principle in sensitive and high-stakes contexts.</li>
                            <li>We prioritize local ownership, inclusion, and responsiveness.</li>
                            <li>We pursue excellence through continuous learning and quality improvement.</li>
                            <li>We believe in long-term partnership, not one-time solutions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="animate-on-scroll">
                        <h3>Our Team</h3>
                        <p>We are a multidisciplinary group of consultants, project managers, trainers, and specialists. Each member brings deep knowledge in their field — from proposal development and MEAL systems to financial planning, PR strategy, and organizational design. We combine strategic expertise with cultural sensitivity, field experience, and a collaborative mindset. This allows us to support a wide range of partners — from grassroots organizations to international development agencies — with agility, professionalism, and care.</p>
